# EYN-OS

It's here. Well, a bit of it at least.

It's mostly unfinished, but there's a kernel and a basic shell. There's some pretty good C integration too, so you can easily add features of your own.

### To build:

To build it, you just need to change to the EYN-OS directory and type 'make build'. Then, run the 'EYNOS.iso' produced with QEMU to boot the OS in a virtual machine.
Or, alternatively, flash the iso to a USB and run it on real hardware! I do it a lot, so I know it works. (Only tested on an old Intel machine)

It's not much at the moment, but I hope to expand it further, now that I have an established codebase.
I hope you enjoy it so far, even if it's not much!
